# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

Please write the Exec Plan in Japanese.
Also, please create the Exec Plan under the .agent directory.

Please refer to existing Exec Plans in the .agent directory for examples.
Unless otherwise specified, the working directory is set to the root directory of the repository.
